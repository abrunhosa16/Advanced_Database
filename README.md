Advanced Database

Overview:
Advanced Database is a project that demonstrates advanced database concepts and techniques, including SQL queries, database management, and optimizations. It allows users to interact with a sample database and perform various operations, such as queries and transformations.

Getting Started:
These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the project locally.

Prerequisites:
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Make (for building the project)
- GCC (or another C++ compiler)
- PostgreSQL (for database functionality)
- PostGIS for spatial data

Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Advanced_Database.git
   cd Advanced_Database

2. Build the project:
   In the project directory, run the following command to compile the source code:
   make

3. Database Setup:
   Ensure your PostgreSQL database is set up correctly. You may need to import a sample database or configure the connection to your own instance. Refer to the database setup section for more details.

Running the Project:
After building the project, you can run the program with the following commands:
1. Compile using:
   make

2. Run the main program:
   ./main

Usage:
Once the program is running, you can interact with the database and execute various operations like queries, data transformations, and more.

Refer to the documentation within the project or the "Usage" section for specific commands and examples.

Testing and Debugging:
For testing purposes, use the built-in queries and transformations on the provided datasets. Ensure your PostgreSQL instance is running and accessible.

Additional Configuration:
If you need to modify configuration settings (such as database credentials or table structures), update the configuration file config.cfg or modify the connection setup within the code.
